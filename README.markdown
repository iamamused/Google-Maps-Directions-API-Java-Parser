#Google Directions API Parser

This is a Java parser which will convert the output of the [Google Directions Api](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/directions/) into a nice set of objects.

My intention is to use this in Android applications as shown in the example. The example shows a route drawn on a [MapView](http://developer.android.com/guide/tutorials/views/hello-mapview.html) map.

##Assumptions

The classes make use of the [GeoPoint](http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/reference/index.html) object so you need to use the Google map libraries in your application. See the Example manifest.
